# anf-samples
This collection of Amazon Network Firewall templates, demonstrates automated approaches involving an AWS Network Firewall Rule Group, paired with an AWS Lambda function to perform steps like, parsing an external source, and keeping the Rule Group automatically up to date.
  
## File Structure
This project consists of CloudFormation Templates and snippets of source code that demonstrate the functional aspects of the approach.
